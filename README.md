This library adds [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org/) support to the open source
[Alfresco Content Management System](http://www.alfresco.com/). Specifically, it:

 * adds an idiomatic Clojure wrapper around (an increasing %age of) the [Alfresco Java API](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Java_Foundation_API)
 * provides support for implementing Alfresco extension points in Clojure, including
   [behaviours](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/behave.clj), and
   [web scripts](https://github.com/lambdalf/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/spring/surf/webscript.clj)
 * adds an nREPL server to the Alfresco server (disabled by default - requires administrator rights to enable),
   allowing for productive REPL-style experimentation and development within Alfresco
 * packages all of this, along with the Clojure runtime, into an [Alfresco Module Package](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files)
   (AMP file) that 3rd party code can depend on (thereby avoiding conflicts between different Clojure extensions)

## Packaging
Due to the way Alfresco's AMP module mechanism works, lambdalf is shipped as an AMP file in addition to the clojars
artifacts (which are used for development only).  It is this AMP artifact that should be deployed to a running
Alfresco server, prior to the deployment of your own AMP.

Your code should also be packaged as an AMP (via the [lein amp plugin](https://github.com/pmonks/lein-amp)), and must
include a module dependency on lambdalf in order to prevent an Alfresco administrator from inadvertently deploying
your AMP without first deploying the lambdalf AMP. In the near future the lein-amp template will [configure these
dependencies up automatically](https://github.com/mstang/alfresco-amp-template/issues/1).

## Installing lambdalf into Alfresco

Download the latest lambdalf AMP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/lambdalf/lambdalf/releases) (NOT YET
AVAILABLE!), then install it just like any other AMP (i.e. using Alfresco's
[MMT tool](https://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Module_Management_Tool)).

### Opening a REPL

For security reasons (i.e. **it opens a massive script injection attack hole!**) the nREPL server included in lambdalf is
not running by default. To enable it (**keeping in mind that it opens a massive script injection attack hole!**) an
administrator-only HTTP POST Web Script is provided at `/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl`. For a default installation
of Alfresco on localhost, you can run:

```shell
    $ curl -u admin:admin -X POST http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl
```

to enable the nREPL server.  The Web Script's JSON response includes the port that the nREPL server is running on
(default is 7888).  From there you can use leiningen's built-in nREPL client to connect to the nREPL server:

```shell
    $ lein repl :connect 7888
```

See below for some example Clojure expressions that can validate the installation (although being able to connect is
itself a good sign that everything's hunky dory).

To disable the nREPL server, you may issue an HTTP DELETE to the same Web Script:

```shell
    $ curl -u admin:admin -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl
```

You may also query the status of the nREPL server via an HTTP GET:

```shell
    $ curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl
```

## Developing with lambdalf

lambdalf is (NOT YET!) available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.lambdalf/lambdalf).
Plonk the following in your project.clj :plugins, `lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
[org.clojars.lambdalf/lambdalf "#.#.#"]
```

The latest version is:

[![version](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.lambdalf/lambdalf/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.lambdalf/lambdalf)

Here's some sample code from an nREPL session connected to a running Alfresco repository. Note that there are
[better ways](https://github.com/lambdalf/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/nodes.clj#L65) to get a handle to the Company
Home `nodeRef`.  Note also that unlike Alfresco's native Java API, each `ResultSet` is automatically closed after a search.

```
    user> (require '[alfresco.auth :as a])
    nil
    user> (require '[alfresco.search :as s])
    nil
    user> (require '[alfresco.nodes :as n])
    nil
    user> (def company-home
              (a/as-admin
               (first
                (s/query "PATH:\"/*\" AND TYPE:\"cm:folder\""))))
    #'user/company-home
    user> (clojure.pprint/pprint
       (a/as-admin
        (n/properties company-home)))
    {"sys:store-identifier" "SpacesStore",
     "cm:modifier" "System",
     "cm:title" "Company Home",
     "cm:description" "The company root space",
     "sys:store-protocol" "workspace",
     "app:icon" "space-icon-default",
     "sys:node-dbid" 13,
     "cm:created" #<Date Sun Sep 04 15:11:18 CEST 2011>,
     "sys:node-uuid" "43356014-0428-4e86-9490-e78a6c0c48ef",
     "cm:modified" #<Date Sun Sep 04 15:11:18 CEST 2011>,
     "cm:name" "Company Home",
     "cm:creator" "System"}
    nil
```
