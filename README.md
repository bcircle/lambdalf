# Lambdalf -- Clojure support for Alfresco

----

This is a substantial fork of Carlo Sciolla's [lambdalf](http://github.com/skuro/lambdalf) project.  The primary difference
is that this version replaces Maven with Leiningen as the build tool, thereby substantially simplifying the project.

----

This library adds [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org/) support to the open source
[Alfresco Content Management System](http://www.alfresco.com/). Specifically, it:

 * adds an idiomatic Clojure wrapper around (an increasing %age of) the [Alfresco Java API](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Java_Foundation_API)
 * provides support for implementing Alfresco extension points in Clojure, including
   [behaviours](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/behave.clj), and
   [web scripts](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/spring/surf/webscript.clj)
 * adds an NREPL server to the Alfresco server (disabled by default - requires administrator rights to enable),
   allowing for productive REPL-style experimentation and development within Alfresco
 * packages all of this, along with the Clojure runtime, into an [Alfresco Module Package](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files)
   that 3rd party code can depend on (thereby avoiding conflicts between different Clojure extensions)

## Packaging
Due to the way Alfresco's AMP module mechanism works, lambdalf is shipped as an [AMP file](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files)
in addition to the clojars artifacts (which are used for development only).  It is this AMP artifact that should be deployed to a
running Alfresco server, prior to the deployment of your own AMP.

Your code should also be packaged as an AMP (via the [lein amp plugin](https://github.com/pmonks/lein-amp)), and must include
a module dependency on lambdalf in order to prevent an Alfresco administrator from inadvertently deploying your code without first deploying
lambdalf. In the near future the lein-amp template should [set these dependencies up automatically](https://github.com/mstang/alfresco-amp-template/issues/1).

## Installing lambdalf into Alfresco

Download the latest [AMP file](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files) from the [releases page](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/releases)
(NOT YET AVAILABLE!), then install it just like any other AMP (i.e. using Alfresco's [MMT tool](https://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Module_Management_Tool)).

### Opening a REPL

For security reasons (i.e. it opens a massive script injection attack hole!) the NREPL server included in lambdalf is not running by default.
To enable it (keeping in mind that it opens a massive script injection attack hole!) an HTTP POST Web Script is provided at
/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl. For a default installation of Alfresco on localhost, you can run:

```shell 
    $ curl -u admin:admin -X POST http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/clojure/nrepl
```

to enable the NREPL server.  The Web Script will respond with the port that the NREPL server is running on (default is 7888).  From there you can
use leiningen's built-in NREPL client to connect to this NREPL:

```shell
    $ lein repl :connect 7888
```

See below for some example expressions to run to validate the installation.

## Developing with lambdalf

lambdalf is (NOT YET!) available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf).
Plonk the following in your project.clj :plugins, `lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
[org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf "#.#.#"]
```

The latest version is:

[![version](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf)

Here's some sample code from an NREPL session connected to a running Alfresco repository. Note that there are
[better ways](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/nodes.clj#L65) to get a handle to the Company
Home `nodeRef`.  Note also that unlike Alfresco's native Java API, each `ResultSet` is automatically closed after a search.

```
    user> (require '[alfresco.auth :as a])
    nil
    user> (require '[alfresco.search :as s])
    nil
    user> (require '[alfresco.nodes :as n])
    nil
    user> (def company-home
              (a/as-admin
               (first
                (s/query "PATH:\"/*\" AND TYPE:\"cm:folder\""))))
    #'user/company-home
    user> (clojure.pprint/pprint
       (a/as-admin
        (n/properties company-home)))
    {"sys:store-identifier" "SpacesStore",
     "cm:modifier" "System",

    nil
