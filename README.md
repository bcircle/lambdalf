# Lambdalf -- Clojure support for Alfresco

----

This is a substantial fork of Carlo Sciolla's [lambdalf](http://github.com/skuro/lambdalf) project.  The primary difference
is that this version replaces Maven with Leiningen as the build tool, thereby substantially simplifying the project.

----

This library adds [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org/) support to the open source
[Alfresco Content Management System](http://www.alfresco.com/). Specifically, it:

 * adds an idiomatic Clojure wrapper around (an increasing %age of) the [Alfresco Java API](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Java_Foundation_API)
 * provides support for implementing Alfresco extension points in Clojure, including
   [behaviours](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/behave.clj), and
   web scripts (via [clojure-webscripts ](https://github.com/skuro/spring-webscripts-addon-clojure))
 * adds NREPL and SWANK servers to the Alfresco system (disabled by default - requires administor rights to enable), allowing for
   productive REPL-style experimentation and development in Alfresco
 * packages all of this, along with the Clojure runtime, into an [Alfresco Module Package](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files)
   that 3rd party code can depend on (thereby avoiding conflicts between different Clojure extensions)

## Developing with lambdalf

lambdalf is (NOT YET!) available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf).
Plonk the following in your project.clj :plugins, `lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
[org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf "#.#.#"]
```

The latest version is:

[![version](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf)

Here's some sample code from an NREPL session connected to a running Alfresco repository. Note that there are
[better ways](https://github.com/pmonks/lambdalf/blob/master/src/clojure/alfresco/nodes.clj#L65) to get a handle to the Company
Home `nodeRef`, and that you don't need to close any `ResultSet` after you query!

```
    user> (require '[alfresco.auth :as a])
    nil
    user> (require '[alfresco.search :as s])
    nil
    user> (require '[alfresco.nodes :as n])
    nil
    user> (def company-home
              (a/as-admin
               (first
                (s/query "PATH:\"/*\" AND TYPE:\"cm:folder\""))))
    #'user/company-home
    user> (clojure.pprint/pprint
       (a/as-admin
        (n/properties company-home)))
    {"sys:store-identifier" "SpacesStore",
     "cm:modifier" "System",
     "cm:title" "Company Home",
     "cm:description" "The company root space",
     "sys:store-protocol" "workspace",
     "app:icon" "space-icon-default",
     "sys:node-dbid" 13,
     "cm:created" #<Date Sun Sep 04 15:11:18 CEST 2011>,
     "sys:node-uuid" "43356014-0428-4e86-9490-e78a6c0c48ef",
     "cm:modified" #<Date Sun Sep 04 15:11:18 CEST 2011>,
     "cm:name" "Company Home",
     "cm:creator" "System"}
    nil
```

## Packaging
Due to the way Alfresco's AMP module mechanism works, lambdalf is shipped as an AMP file (####TODO: add link to release,
once available) in addition to the clojars artifacts (which are intended for compilation only).  It is this AMP artifact that
should be deployed to a running Alfresco server, prior to deployment of your own AMP.

Your code should also be packaged as an AMP (via the [lein amp](https://github.com/pmonks/lein-amp) plugin), and must include
a module dependency on lambdalf in order to prevent an Alfresco user from inadvertently deploying your code without first deploying
lambdalf. In the near future the lein-amp plugin should [handle this automatically](https://github.com/pmonks/lein-amp/issues/2).
